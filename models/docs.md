{% docs convert_values -%}
By default, this value kept in its raw form. However, in some currencies, it may be useful to divide the value by 100 to get the major currency unit. This works for scenarios in which the currency has a minor unit, which is displayed in the raw data, and major unit. For example, if in USD, if the raw value is 100, this represents 100 cents which then gets converted to $1 dollar, the major currency unit. To invoke the division, set the variable stripe__convert_values to True (False by default). If your currency does not contain minor units (for example the Japanese Yen Â¥ which does not use decimals), you can run the package as-is. Note that in a future release, the division by 100 will be enabled by default instead.
